## Simulation1
- J1A: 6 -> 10 -> 6
- J1B: -6 -> -10 -> -6
- J2: 0 -> 10 -> 0

1a.gif and 1b.gif are the same simulation sequence but with a differet angle


## Simulation2
- J1A: 10 -> 6 -> 10
- J1B: -10 -> -6 -> -10
- J2: 0 -> 10 -> 0

2a.gif and 2b.gif are the same simulation sequence but with a differet angle
